      "[{'title': 'A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ramp Metering Based on Traffic Video Data', 'summary': 'Ramp metering that uses traffic signals to regulate vehicle flows from the on-ramps has been widely implemented to improve vehicle mobility of the freeway. Previous studies generally update signal timings in real-time based on predefined traffic measures collected by point detectors, such as traffic volumes and occupancies. Comparing with point detectors, traffic cameras-which have been increasingly deployed on road networks-could cover larger areas and provide more detailed traffic information. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to explore the potential of traffic video data in improving the efficiency of ramp metering. The proposed method uses traffic video frames as inputs and learns the optimal control strategies directly from the high-dimensional visual inputs. A real-world case study demonstrates that, in comparison with a state-of-the-practice method, the proposed DRL method results in 1) lower travel times in the mainline, 2) shorter vehicle queues at the on-ramp, and 3) higher traffic flows downstream of the merging area. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to extract useful information from the video data for better ramp metering controls.', 'authors': ['Bing Liu', 'Yu Tang', 'Yuxiong Ji', 'Yu Shen', 'Yuchuan Du'], 'arxiv_id': '2012.12104v1', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12104v1', 'pdf_link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12104v1'}, {'title': 'Rethink AI-based Power Grid Control: Diving Into Algorithm Design', 'summary': 'Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach has shown promisein solving complex decision and control problems in power engineering domain.In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of DRL-based voltage control fromaspects of algorithm selection, state space representation, and reward engineering.To resolve observed issues, we propose a novel imitation learning-based approachto directly map power grid operating points to effective actions without any interimreinforcement learning process.

In the simplest attack scenario, more than 78% of these reconstructed templates succeed in unlocking an account (when the system is configured to 0.1% FAR).

This algorithm configuration procedure works by first selecting a portfolio of diverse algorithm parameter settings, and then, on a given problem instance, using an algorithm selector to choose a parameter setting from the portfolio with strong predicted performance. Oftentimes, both the portfolio and the algorithm selector are chosen using a training set of typical problem instances from the application domain at hand. In this paper, we provide the first provable guarantees for portfolio-based algorithm selection. We analyze how large the training set should be to ensure that the resulting algorithm selector's average performance over the training set is close to its future (expected) performance. This involves analyzing three key reasons why these two quantities may diverge: 1) the learning-theoretic complexity of the algorithm selector, 2) the size of the portfolio, and 3) the learning-theoretic complexity of the algorithm's performance as a function of its parameters. We introduce an end-to-end learning-theoretic analysis of the portfolio construction and algorithm selection together. We prove that if the portfolio is large, overfitting is inevitable, even with an extremely simple algorithm selector. With experiments, we illustrate a tradeoff exposed by our theoretical analysis: as we increase the portfolio size, we can hope to include a well-suited parameter setting for every possible problem instance, but it becomes impossible to avoid overfitting.\", 'authors': ['Maria-Florina Balcan', 'Tuomas Sandholm', 'Ellen Vitercik'], 'arxiv_id': '2012.13315v1', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13315v1', 'pdf_link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13315v1'}, {'title': 'I like fish, especially dolphins: Addressing Contradictions in Dialogue Modeling', 'summary': 'To quantify how well natural language understanding models can capture consistency in a general conversation, we introduce the DialoguE COntradiction DEtection task (DECODE) and a new conversational dataset containing both human-human and human-bot contradictory dialogues.

State-of-the-art methods in this direction usually cast the problem as to learn a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g., webpages, products). The top-N results are then provided to users as recommendations, where the N is usually a fixed number pre-defined by the system according to some heuristic criteria (e.g., page size, screen size). There is one major assumption underlying this fixed-number recommendation scheme, i.e., there are always sufficient relevant items to users' preferences. Unfortunately, this assumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios. In some applications, there might be very limited candidate items to recommend, and some users may have very high relevance requirement in recommendation. In this way, even the top-1 ranked item may not be relevant to a user's preference. Therefore, we argue that it is critical to provide a dynamic-K recommendation, where the K should be different with respect to the candidate item set and the target user. We formulate this dynamic-K recommendation task as a joint learning problem with both ranking and classification objectives. The ranking objective is the same as existing methods, i.e., to create a ranking list of items according to users' interests. The classification objective is unique in this work, which aims to learn a personalized decision boundary to differentiate the relevant items from irrelevant items. Based on these ideas, we extend two state-of-the-art ranking-based recommendation methods, i.e., BPRMF and HRM, to the corresponding dynamic-K versions, namely DK-BPRMF and DK-HRM. Our experimental results on two datasets show that the dynamic-K models are more effective than the original fixed-N recommendation methods.\", 'authors': ['Yan Gao', 'Jiafeng Guo', 'Yanyan Lan', 'Huaming Liao'], 'arxiv_id': '2012.13569v1', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13569v1', 'pdf_link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13569v1'}, {'title': 'Compliance Generation for Privacy Documents under GDPR: A Roadmap for Implementing Automation and Machine Learning', 'summary': 'Most prominent research today addresses compliance with data protection laws through consumer-centric and public-regulatory approaches.

Caries lesions are typically diagnosed by radiologists relying only on their visual inspection to detect via dental x-rays. In many cases, dental caries is hard to identify using x-rays and can be misinterpreted as shadows due to different reasons such as low image quality. Hence, developing a decision support system for caries detection has been a topic of interest in recent years. Here, we propose an automatic diagnosis system to detect dental caries in Panoramic images for the first time, to the best of authors' knowledge. The proposed model benefits from various pretrained deep learning models through transfer learning to extract relevant features from x-rays and uses a capsule network to draw prediction results. On a dataset of 470 Panoramic images used for features extraction, including 240 labeled images for classification, our model achieved an accuracy score of 86.05\\\\% on the test set. The obtained score demonstrates acceptable detection performance and an increase in caries detection speed, as long as the challenges of using Panoramic x-rays of real patients are taken into account. Among images with caries lesions in the test set, our model acquired recall scores of 69.44\\\\% and 90.52\\\\% for mild and severe ones, confirming the fact that severe caries spots are more straightforward to detect and efficient mild caries detection needs a more robust and larger dataset.

However, little research has been put to understand and interpret the black-box nature of these deep-learning based scoring models. Recent work shows that automated scoring systems are prone to even common-sense adversarial samples. Their lack of natural language understanding capability raises questions on the models being actively used by millions of candidates for life-changing decisions. With scoring being a highly multi-modal task, it becomes imperative for scoring models to be validated and tested on all these modalities. We utilize recent advances in interpretability to find the extent to which features such as coherence, content and relevance are important for automated scoring mechanisms and why they are susceptible to adversarial samples. We find that the systems tested consider essays not as a piece of prose having the characteristics of natural flow of speech and grammatical structure, but as `word-soups' where a few words are much more important than the other words. Removing the context surrounding those few important words causes the prose to lose the flow of speech and grammar, however has little impact on the predicted score.

New technologies for text generation ranging from template-based methods to neural network-based methods emerged. Meanwhile, the research objectives have also changed from generating smooth and coherent sentences to infusing personalized traits to enrich the diversification of newly generated content. With the rapid development of text generation solutions, one comprehensive survey is urgent to summarize the achievements and track the state of the arts. In this survey paper, we present the general systematical framework, illustrate the widely utilized models and summarize the classic applications of text generation.', 'authors': ['Qiuyun Zhang', 'Bin Guo', 'Hao Wang', 'Yunji Liang', 'Shaoyang Hao', 'Zhiwen Yu'], 'arxiv_id': '1905.01984v1', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01984v1', 'pdf_link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01984v1'}]\n"

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n    </blockquote>\\n\\n
